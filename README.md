# Checkout Times for Users
![chart 1](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png)
Looking at the amount of time people have bikes checked out for, we see that a large % of people are using the bikes for a short period of time (less than 20 minutes) and while there are people who use the bikes for more than an hour, the frequency is much lower than with shorter trips.

# Checkout Times by Gender 
![chart 3](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)
As we split out the bike usage by gender, we see that men are using the service on the most popular time of just under 10 minutes at least 3x more than women.  Once we get to a 45 minute ride, the split between gender dissapears, though as mentioned before the number of riders decrease as we approach 60 minutes and beyond.  

# Trips by Weekday per Hour 
![chart 4](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)
We see some of the highest usage on Thursdays from 5-7pm, with some strong usage during the sames time on Monday & Tuesday.  Monday to Friday we also see some good demand from 8-9pm as people are going to work/school.  Weekends have good usage between 9am and 8pm, but Saturdays have more volume than Sundays.

# Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) 
![chart 5](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
The trends we saw in terms of weekday and time usage can really be seen on the male view of this information.  You can see some of this same trend with female and unknown, however it is not a pronouced as there are just not as many riders from those two genders, when compared to the number of males.  When looking at the male view and comparing to the prior (all genders together) chart, we see the trends we see with male riders impact the total riders such that the trends look very similar when compared.  

# User Trips by Gender by Weekday 
![chart 6](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
Looking at this chart we can see that subcription riders drive much more of the demand than casual customers.  Its interesting howerver tha with female riders, this observation is the opposite, there are more women riders who are casual customers versus subscribers.  Understanding the differences between different gender behaviour can impact the makreting plan for the service.

# Usage by Hour
![chart 7](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Usage%20by%20Hour.png)
We can see that there are some peak periods for bike usage - 7-9am as people are getting to work/school most days of the week and 4-9pm as people are heading home after their day or out and about enjoying the city.  There is a natuaral low in demand from 1-4am, which is a great opportunity for bike maintenance as that is when the most bikes will be available to be serviced.  We can also see there are large differences in the number of bikes you might need at 5pm and even 10pm, which means that many bikes will be sitting idle for a portion of the day. 

# Top Starting Locations 
![chart 8](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Top%20Starting%20Location.png)
We can see in the map that the starting stations with the highest volume are in areas where there are many people going to different places (work, school, home, social, ect.) which highlights the importance of choosing the right locations for the bike stations to ensure many people have an opportunity to use as there are many people going by.

# Top Ending Locations 
![chart 9](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Top%20Ending%20Locations.png)
The most used ending locations are also in the same very busy (lots of people) locations, which holds as we saw earlier that most trips were very short (many less than 10 mins).  This highlights the importance of having stations located in high people traffic areas, where there are many different reasons people may want transportation.  Setting up a bik e program in a busy downtown core seems to work very well.

# Top Starting and Ending Locations
![chart 10](https://github.com/tessiertodd/bikesharing/blob/main/Start%20and%20End%20Stations.png)
Here are the views of both the start and ending bike stations so that we can that they are both very similar in terms of usage.

# Summary
While there are many things to consider, here are a few key highlights for making...
